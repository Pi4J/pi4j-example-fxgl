Ideas to extend the application:

* Button to start/pause the game
* During game play at random places put food, when snake eats it, it becomes larger (instead of the current "
  F-button-hack")
* Snake touches border -> loose life and restart
* Extend the game with other electronics:
    * RGB LED (strip?) to visualize eating/dying/...
    * Speaker for sound effects on eating/dying/...
    * Extra buttons for ... ?
* IMPORTANT: this example project should not become too big as it would then be hard to use it as a base for other
  users. Please keep this in mind, and when you want to "go crazy", please extend further in a separate repository.
